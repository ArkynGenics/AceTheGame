## Prerequisite
Before you start, you need to download the tools first:
- ATG for memory scanning and editing (GUI): `app-release.apk` which can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/KuhakuPixel/AceTheGame/releases/latest)
- BillingHack to bypass in-app purchase: `BillingHack.apk` which can be downloaded from [here](links)

## Apk
### ATG
   1. ### Select Running Process
      Open the ATG apk and choose the name of the desired game you want to run this exploit for
      > Note: If the desired game doesn't appear, make sure to click the refresh button `â†»`

   1. ### Scanning For Value

      1. Open the ATG and move to the `Memory` tab 
      
      1. Put the current value of the item (coin, diamond, etc) you want to change inside the `Scan For` input field and press `Next Scan` to retrieve all the addresses that has that value

      1. If the number of matching addresses is too large, filter down the number of matching addresses by increasing/decreasing the item value and scan for that increased/decreased value
         > Repeat the steps above as many times as possible if you think the number of matching addresses is still too large
      1. Click on the remaining address and it will be added to the `Address Table` tab, where you can start editing its value to your desired value
      1. Switch to the `address table` tab and click on the `value` cell to edit its value
      1. Put any value that you wanted and press `Okay`
      1. Change the item value by increase/decrease the value to update its UI
      
### BillingHack
- You just need to download `BillingHack.apk` and patch the game/apk, and then you can immediately use it :D

   (ACE) 
   ```
   1. ### List Running Process
      List running processes with:
      ```
      ps ls
      ```

      ```
      (ACE) ps ls
      ...
      ...
      52507 brave
      52641 brave
      52778 adb
      52785 kworker/4:2-events
      52850 brave
      52867 brave
      52889 brave
      54795 opensurge
      ```
   1. ### select running process
      Lets say we want to attach to `opensurge`
      ```
      (ACE) cheater 54795
      ```
      Now you should be attached
      ```
      attaching to process 54795 
      set type to int
      (CHEATER)
      ```


   1. ### Scanning for value
      Lets say in the game, there is a coin with value of `3`

      We gonna have to search for the address of that coin in order to have infinite coin

      ```
      (CHEATER) scan = 3
      ```

      Then its gonna take a while and output something like:

      ```
      current matches: 13946
      Done in: 1.347762 s
      ```

      Now we just change the coin value in the game and scan for the changed value to further filter all of the addresses that we got

      Lets say we collect one more coin so our coin becomes `4` right now.

      We just scan for 4.

      ```
      (CHEATER) scan = 4
      ```

      ```
      current matches: 20
      Done in: 0.021650 s
      ```

      Repeat the steps above until you got 1-3 matches

   1. ### writting to matches
      Now that you have the address of the coin which can be seen by the list command,
      ```
      (CHEATER) list
      0x55b525a27650 7
      ```
      you can write any value you want to it by using
      ```
      (CHEATER) write 999999
      ```
      and now you should have `999999` coin




   You can also use this as a library in your apk/project
