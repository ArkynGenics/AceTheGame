# ROADMAP

## Building the AutomaticInjector
Inject the `lib_ACE` and start it to scan and edit 
memory of an apk without any root!

This gonna be written in java with gradle as the build tool
structure: Monolithic with apktool as such as a gitsubmodule
### List and download apk from computer
a gui written in swing would be awesome
Useful when there is split apk: https://github.com/sensepost/objection/issues/358

## Android GUI For Ace ENgine
this has 2 modes
### non rooted
listen and send request to the port started by ace engine
for scan and editting memory
### rooted
list and select a process and just scan and editting memory
