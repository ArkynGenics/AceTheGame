# ROADMAP

## ATG

### More descriptive name for `Scan Type`

like cheat engine, where the name of scan type
is `Exact Scan`, `Less than` and etc are more readable
than `=`, `<`

### Option to add address manually to address table

### Option to add all matches to address table

### Option to Pause while scanning

### Freeze value of an address

### show value of an address in real time 

### Undo
add an option to limit matches count
that can be undo-ed so it won't consume
too much memory

### Debugger
A Hard one for sure, probably gonna use lldb

## ACE
### Use data-format like json for communication
currently messages sent by `ACE` 
's status are hard to know because it only sent
the "raw" message

like when giving request, its hard to know
if the request is a success or failure
