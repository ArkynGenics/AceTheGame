- maybe include all of decompiled smali code for injection?
  in `./gen_smali.py`

- port ace engine to this repo, so that it can be built
  automatically, learn android ndk? 
================================================================
learning smali (java assembly?) is important because 
I need to learn how to patch/ reverse engineer an apk
using apktool

- Learn basics of smali like how functions are called,
  assignments, loops, if else and ect like basic of programming

- Learn how native is called

- how a package "import" another package in smali?
  this will be useful because I want the core library in java
  to be injected to the apk
  

- lets try to inject our custom package
  to an apk, by calling a function 
  like a call to logcat or something

- is it possible to make a java call? by patching smali



- CREATE AUTOMATOR FOR INJECTING JAVA CODE
- learn multi repo management tool no git submodule of course
- import apktool 
- create finder of main activity
